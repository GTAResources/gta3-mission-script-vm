gta3-mission-script-vm
======================

Virtual machine for executing GTA3-engine game mission scripts.

This is a really dumb project because nothing's going to happen without the rest of the game engine/ai but oh well.

Colour screenshot of it running, you can see it highlighting symbols in the bytecode.
green = opcode, pink = data type, blue = actual value bytes
It also colours allocations in memory, seen on the lines starting with ooooooo8.
